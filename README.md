## Description 

Person segmentation is critical task in analysing humans on images for many real-world applications: action recognition, self-driving cars, video surveillance, mobile applications and much more.

We at Supervisely had our internal research on this field and we realized that there is a lack of data for this task. You can ask us: what about public datasets like COCO, Pascal, Mapillary and others? To answer this question i’ll better show you few examples from COCO dataset:

The quality of human segmentation in most public datasets is not satisfied our requirements and we had to create our own dataset with high quality annotations.
